Context: Enhanced the Lisp Dialect Showcase project with better tmux integration and Clojure development support.

Considerations:
- The .envrc file already had project variables, making integration straightforward
- Makefile already had tmux targets, demonstrating good project structure
- Enhanced existing Emacs configuration rather than replacing it
- Added comprehensive tmux session script with multi-window support for different REPLs

Technical Details:
- CIDER configuration optimized for Clojure development with paredit and rainbow-delimiters
- Project variables sourced from environment for consistency across tools
- Tmux session script provides start/stop/attach/status/restart commands
- Three tmux windows created: Emacs, REPL (with split panes), and Shell

Issues Resolved:
- Better integration between tmux sessions and project-specific Emacs configuration
- Improved REPL experience with proper history file locations
- Added project navigation functions for easier file discovery

Timing: ~15 minutes
- Analysis and planning: 3 minutes
- Implementation: 10 minutes
- Testing and verification: 2 minutes

Future Improvements:
- Could add automatic REPL startup for each dialect in tmux panes
- Consider adding direnv integration for automatic environment loading
- May want to add session persistence/restore functionality
