Implementation notes:

Thought process:
- Systematic analysis revealed multiple critical issues preventing example execution
- Prioritized fixing blocking syntax errors first, then compatibility issues
- Focused on making code work with standard installations without requiring additional packages

Debugging/Issues encountered:
- Clojure: Malformed namespace declarations with embedded prn/binding statements
- Clojure: Run script wasn't calling -main functions, needed explicit invocation
- Common Lisp: Missing exports prevented SBCL from finding run-examples functions
- Emacs Lisp: CL-style optional parameters not supported, needed manual default handling
- Emacs Lisp: isqrt function not available in older versions, implemented int-sqrt
- Emacs Lisp: cl-lib functions caused dependency issues, replaced with built-ins
- Racket: racket/memoize module not available, implemented manual memoization

Cleanup performed:
- Standardized function export patterns across Common Lisp packages
- Replaced external dependencies with built-in alternatives where possible
- Ensured cross-platform compatibility for all dialect implementations
- Verified all examples run successfully after fixes

Technical decisions:
- Chose manual implementations over external dependencies for better portability
- Used global hash tables for Emacs Lisp memoization to avoid closure complexity
- Kept original algorithm logic intact while fixing syntax/compatibility issues

Future improvements:
- Consider adding automated testing to catch regressions
- Explore more sophisticated memoization patterns for educational value
- Add error handling and input validation to examples
