Context:
- User requested adding project name/root environment variables either in .envrc or Makefile
- Implemented tmux session management for working with Scheme code using Emacs
- Enhanced support for Geiser, Guile3, Org-mode, TRAMP, and Paredit

Considerations:
- Created .envrc file for direnv integration (common in development workflows)
- Used environment variables that can be overridden for flexibility
- Made tmux session management non-destructive (checks for existing sessions)
- Enhanced Emacs configuration with specific Guile3 binary path
- Added Paredit alongside existing Smartparens for user preference

Issues addressed:
- Project needed better environment setup for consistent development
- Tmux session management was missing for persistent Emacs sessions
- Scheme development tooling needed enhancement (Geiser configuration)

Timing:
- Implementation completed on 2025-08-06
- Changes align with project's focus on Lisp dialect development
- Builds on existing project structure without breaking changes

Technical details:
- .envrc exports PROJECT_NAME, PROJECT_ROOT for use in Make and scripts
- Tmux targets provide start/stop/attach functionality
- Emacs config enhanced with Geiser-specific settings for Guile3
- TRAMP configured for potential remote development scenarios
