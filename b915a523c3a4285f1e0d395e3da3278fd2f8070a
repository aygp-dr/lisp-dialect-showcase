Implementation notes:

Thought process:
- Ran make lint-scripts to identify shellcheck warnings
- Systematically addressed each warning with proper fixes
- Maintained functional behavior while improving code quality

Issues fixed:
- SC2028: echo escape sequences - replaced with printf for proper handling
- SC2176: time command in pipeline - wrapped problematic time calls in bash -c
- SC2012: ls command usage - replaced with find for safer file handling
- SC2046: unquoted command substitution - added proper quoting

Technical decisions:
- Used printf instead of echo for escape sequences for better portability
- Used find instead of ls for more robust file searching
- Added quotes around all variable expansions to prevent word splitting
- Maintained existing functionality while improving safety

Code quality improvements:
- All shell scripts now pass shellcheck without warnings
- Improved robustness of file operations
- Better handling of special characters in filenames
